# Lab 19: National Parks + Analysis #
## Goal: ##
_Critically analyze designs incorporating basic control structures and object-oriented design techniques._
## Introduction ##
For this lab you will be analyzing the code of an example Unit Deliverable project. The project meets requirements but is missing all documentation and some design choices could be improved.
## To Do ##
### 1. Add documentation and comments. ###
  -  At the top of Main.java and Park.java add descriptions summarizing each class in a javadoc comment.
  -  Before each method add a method description using a javadoc comment.
  -  Add a comment for each line of code in the ```main``` method to describe what the program is doing.
### 2. Suggest improvements. ###
Identify at least two significant ways the code can be improved without changing the functionality of the program. Describe the changes suggested and reason below.

## Submit ##
There are no tests for this lab.  This assignment will be used for course student learning outcome assessment and will be scored using the following rubric:
  - complete : No Java code is changed, a reasonable description is provided for each class and method, at least ten in-line comments are included to explain the existing code, and two or more substantive code improvements are suggested.
  - incomplete : Java code is altered from what was given, one or more class/method descriptions are missing, less than ten comments provided, or only zero or one substantive code improvement suggested.
